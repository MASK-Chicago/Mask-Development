Extend Fusion with a Map Element.

== Description ==

The Map Element embeds a responsive map into the page.

There are 2 built in map types:

**Google Map Embed**

Allows you to use a Google Maps embed code to easily embed any map directly from Google.

**Google Map Custom**

Allows you to build a custom Google Map with a wide range of options for customizing the mapâ€™s positioning, type, controls, styles, and markers.

*This option uses the Google Maps JavaScript API and requires an [API Key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key).*

**Requires the core [Fusion](https://wordpress.org/plugins/fusion/) plugin.**

= About Fusion =

Fusion is a flexible and expandable page builder for WordPress. It focuses on providing a powerful, user friendly experience that aims to closely emulate the native WordPress look and feel.

Built on the popular Bootstrap framework, Fusion will allow you to easily split your theme's content area into responsive multi-column layouts.

The Core plugin includes elements for outputting text and raw code into the columns while our free Expansion plugins add all the functionality you need for your WordPress site including Galleries, Videos, and Maps.

Fusion also allows you to create Components and Templates. Components are pieces of a layout that can be repeated across several different pages and edited / maintained in one place, and Templates are full page layouts that can be loaded and modified to easily create new pages.

Fusion is designed to be developer friendly, making it possible for WordPress plugin and theme developers to add, modify, and expand the Fusion ecosystem to limitless horizons.
