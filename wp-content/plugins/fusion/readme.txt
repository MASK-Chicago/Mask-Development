Fusion. The forever free, natively powerful, beautifully flexible, and easily expandable page builder for Wordpress.

== Description ==

Fusion is a flexible and expandable page builder for WordPress. It focuses on providing a powerful, user friendly experience that aims to closely emulate the native WordPress look and feel.

Built on the popular Bootstrap framework, Fusion will allow you to easily split your theme's content area into responsive multi-column layouts.

The Core plugin includes elements for outputting text and raw code into the columns while our free Extension plugins add all the functionality you need for your WordPress site including Galleries, Videos, and Maps.

Fusion also allows you to create Components and Templates. Components are pieces of a layout that can be repeated across several different pages and edited / maintained in one place, and Templates are full page layouts that can be loaded and modified to easily create new pages.

Fusion is designed to be developer friendly, making it possible for WordPress plugin and theme developers to add, modify, and expand the Fusion ecosystem to limitless horizons.

= Fusion Base Theme =

The Fusion Base Theme is a blank-canvas theme that is designed to work hand in hand with the Fusion plugin. The post and page templates use the entire browser window for post content output, meaning every aspect of your page is controlled by Fusion. This makes for limitless possibilities when it comes to the look and feel of your site.

The Fusion Base also adds a Layout page in the admin for building a Master Layout for your site. This allows you to add and arrange Components that are output above and/or below the post content on every post and page. This feature is most useful for building custom headers and footers that are easy to maintain from one location.
